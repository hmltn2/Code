# LLM Benchmarker

LLM Benchmarker is a Python package designed to help you monitor and improve your Language Learning Model (LLM). It provides a simple, effective benchmarking algorithm for automatically identifying weak points in your LLM. These weak points could be in areas such as training data, human reinforcement training, prompt effectiveness, or multi-agent system effectiveness and capability.

## Features

LLM Benchmarker provides various methods to "average" a list of prompts, providing an "average" prompt that represents the common trends in the list of prompts. This can be useful in identifying trends and commonalities in the prompts that your LLM is dealing with.

The package also provides a method to run a single prompt on your LLM multiple times and store the outputs, which can be useful for identifying inconsistencies in your LLM's responses.

## Testing

LLM Benchmarker includes a test suite that verifies the functionality of its key components. The tests make use of Python's built-in `unittest` module. The tests can be run using the following command:
